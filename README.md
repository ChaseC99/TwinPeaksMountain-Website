# TwinPeaksMountain-Website
A website for Twin Peaks Mountain, located in Poway, California.

### Background
Twin Peaks has always been my favorite mountain.
Although it's only a half an hour hike, the view from the top is fantastic.
On a clear day, you can see all of San Diego.

I felt as though Twin Peaks was an underrated gem in my home town, so I made this website to show off its beauty.

### The Website
The website consists of a home page and pages about the hike, the wild life, the plants, and how to prepare for the hike.  
I will continue to add more pictures throughout the website
in order to clarify information and to get people excited about Twin Peaks Mountain.

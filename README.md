# TwinPeaksMountain-Website
A website for Twin Peaks Mountain, located in Poway, California.

### Background
Twin Peaks has always been my favorite mountain.
Although it's only a half an hour hike, the view from the top is fantastic.
On a clear day, you can see all of San Diego.

I felt as though Twin Peaks was an underated gem in my home town, so I made this website to show off its beauty.
